**Wifitex** is a comprehensive wireless security testing tool for Linux, featuring both command-line and modern GUI interfaces. It's a complete rewrite of the original [`wifite`](https://github.com/derv82/wifite) with enhanced capabilities, better architecture, and modern features.

## üöÄ Key Features

### **Modern Dual Interface**
- **CLI Mode**: Traditional command-line interface for power users
- **GUI Mode**: Modern PyQt6-based graphical interface with dark theme
- **Seamless Integration**: Both interfaces share the same powerful backend

### **Advanced Attack Capabilities**
- **WPS Attacks**: Pixie-Dust and PIN brute-force attacks
- **WPA/WPA2 Attacks**: Handshake capture and PMKID hash extraction
- **KARMA Attack**: Enhanced Evil Twin with PNL (Preferred Network List) capture
- **Multi-Interface Support**: Run multiple Evil Twin APs simultaneously

### **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live network scanning with automatic updates
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed attack progress with status indicators
- **Tool Management**: Automatic dependency checking and tool status monitoring
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Exportable logs with filtering capabilities
- **Settings Management**: Persistent configuration with import/export

## üéØ Attack Methods

Wifitex supports all known methods for retrieving wireless access point passwords:

1. **WPS Pixie-Dust Attack**: Offline brute-force attack against WPS vulnerabilities
2. **WPS PIN Attack**: Online brute-force attack against WPS PIN authentication
3. **WPA Handshake Capture**: 4-way handshake capture and offline cracking
4. **PMKID Hash Capture**: Modern PMKID hash extraction and cracking
5. **KARMA Attack**: Advanced Evil Twin with victim preference exploitation

> **Note**: WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) attacks are not implemented in wifitex. WEP was deprecated in 2004 due to severe security vulnerabilities and is considered obsolete. While aircrack-ng supports WEP cracking, wifitex focuses on modern wireless security testing (WPA/WPA2/WPS/KARMA). WEP attack implementation is planned for future development but is currently not available.

> **Test Files**: Some test files contain WEP network data (`wep-crackable.ivs`, `wep-uncrackable.ivs`) for historical reference and potential future WEP attack implementation testing.
